      <h2>ABOUT</h2>
      <p>The Memory Game, often referred to as the Flip Card Game, is a classic card-matching game that challenges players' memory and concentration skills. The game consists of a set of cards placed face down on a surface. Players take turns flipping two cards at a time, trying to find matching pairs. If a player successfully matches two cards, they remove them from the game and earn another turn. If the cards do not match, they are turned back face down, and the next player takes their turn. The game continues until all pairs are matched, and the player with the most pairs wins.</p>

   <h2>INVENTOR & HISTORY</h2>
   <p>The origins of the Memory Game can be traced back to traditional card games that have been played for centuries. While it is difficult to pinpoint a specific inventor, variations of memory-based games have appeared in various cultures. The modern version gained popularity in the mid-20th century, especially as educational tools for children to enhance cognitive skills. Over time, it has evolved into numerous digital formats and mobile applications, making it accessible to a wider audience.</p>

   <h2>ALGORITHM</h2>
   <p>The algorithm for the Memory Game can be summarized in a few key steps:

Initialization:

Create an array of pairs of cards (e.g., images or symbols).

Shuffle the array randomly.

Display the shuffled cards face down.

Player Turn:

A player selects two cards to flip.

Check if the two selected cards match:

If they match:

Remove the pair from play.

Allow the player to take another turn.

If they do not match:

Flip the cards back face down.

Pass the turn to the next player.

End of Game:

The game ends when all pairs are matched.

The player with the most pairs collected is declared the winner.

Optimal Strategy:

Players should remember the positions of previously flipped cards to maximize their chances of finding matches.

Advanced strategies may involve dynamic programming techniques to analyze optimal moves based on remaining cards</p>
