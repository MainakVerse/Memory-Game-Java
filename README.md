      <h2>ABOUT</h2>
      <p>The Memory Game, often referred to as the Flip Card Game, is a classic card-matching game that challenges players' memory and concentration skills. The game consists of a set of cards placed face down on a surface. Players take turns flipping two cards at a time, trying to find matching pairs. If a player successfully matches two cards, they remove them from the game and earn another turn. If the cards do not match, they are turned back face down, and the next player takes their turn. The game continues until all pairs are matched, and the player with the most pairs wins.</p>

   <h2>INVENTOR & HISTORY</h2>
   <p>The origins of the Memory Game can be traced back to traditional card games that have been played for centuries. While it is difficult to pinpoint a specific inventor, variations of memory-based games have appeared in various cultures. The modern version gained popularity in the mid-20th century, especially as educational tools for children to enhance cognitive skills. Over time, it has evolved into numerous digital formats and mobile applications, making it accessible to a wider audience.</p>

   <h2>ALGORITHM</h2>
   <p>The algorithm for the Memory Game can be summarized in a few key steps:
   The algorithm for the Memory Game consists of several essential steps. First, an array of paired cards, such as images or symbols, is created and shuffled randomly before being displayed face down. During a player's turn, they select two cards to flip over and check for a match. If the cards match, the pair is removed from play, and the player is granted another turn. Conversely, if there is no match, the cards are flipped back face down, and the turn passes to the next player. The game concludes when all pairs have been matched, with the player who collected the most pairs declared the winner. To enhance their chances of success, players should remember the positions of previously flipped cards. More advanced strategies may incorporate dynamic programming techniques to evaluate optimal moves based on the remaining cards.</p>
